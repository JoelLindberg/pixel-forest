            <p>Experiment to learn more about the transport (tcp) and application protocols (http) as it's so widely used today (and growing). I decided to approach this with a reverse engineering mindset while also looking at any protocol documentation that can be found. Using tools such as netcat/telnet, network trace (tcpdump/wireshark) and my own custom tcp client to create dummy requests during the development.</p>

            <h3>🌳 What's this?</h3>
            <p>You have found a place where I (Joel) make some notes about my personal and work life as well as whatever interests me and creates purpose in life.</p>
    
            <p>I'd like to consider myself a kind, patient and curious person.</p>

            <p>👓 I'm working in IT as a technical specalist/sysadmin. IT was and still is my first choice of career. A field where I have over the last 15 years built experience in infrastructure, applications, programming & databases. I did spend a couple of years doing 3D visualization in-between, and those years taught me many valuable lessons in life and also resulted in experience I could bring back to my work in IT. I believe multiple disciplines can converge into interesting paths and know that I would not be where I am today otherwise.</p>

            <p>My whole career has therefore always touched digital technology in one way or another and creativity has been a common denominator. Since around 2018 I decided to further strengthen my programming skills. First of all because I enjoy it but also because it's a natural progression as demand for automation is increasing.</p>
                
            <p>I value pragmatic technology choices but do find myself sometimes dabbling with something that doesn't make any sense other than that it's fun. I have been involved (at various levels) in most parts of a traditional IT infrastructure. Nowadays I often find myself working more across those traditional borders, often with one leg in infra and the other in some application or development part as well. This way of working is my cup of tea ☕.</p>
                
            <p>🐢 Live in the present, focus on your work at hand and remember to embrace and cherish your loved ones every day.</p>
            
            <p>💖 to my 🐯🐕</p>
