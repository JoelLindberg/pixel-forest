<p>I'm a Cloud/Site Reliability/Platform engineer. These titles are ever in motion, but the important concepts still apply.

I'd like to consider myself a kind, patient and curious person. I consider my choice of profession a lifelong journey, where you calmly add one bit at a time and accept that you will never really reach your end goal because it is constantly evolving.
    
My whole career is spent within technology in one way or another. Since around 2018 I have, with more serious intent been adding programming to my skill set. I do believe this is a natural progression (a very joyful one) as demand for automation, self service and interconnectivity is increasing.
    
I enjoy delivering value by both building tools myself and working with third party tools. I have been involved in most parts of a typical IT infrastructure, lately adding a better understanding for developer UX to the mix and can therefore bring a balanced view.
    
While I consider that work-life balance is very important I have a habit of devoting some of my spare time to learn new things, both out of need but most importantly enjoyment. This is a personal trait.</p>
