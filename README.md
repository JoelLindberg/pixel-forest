# arcane scroll

Joel's tech space in the cloud ☁

The idea is to keep my learnings that I wish to highlight in a single page. Top to bottom, like an ancient scroll. I found a *scrolls* to be a suitable concept for my page and fitting in the name since scrolling is what you inherently need to do on a top-to-bottom only page.

**Constraint**: No use of images. Only fonts, unicode icons and code generated graphics.

I added this constraint to keep it simple and easy to go back and update this page, because otherwise I fear I will not.

I decided to rely heavily on unicode icons. To avoid having to spend too much time searching I want to build a reference library for the icons I am using and think I will be needing in the future:
